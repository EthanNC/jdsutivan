His strong work ethic was deep-seated into our weekly training practices, from strength and agility training to team-building exercises. He would always show up early and stay late to make the most of the time we had to practice, and would always provide an encouraging and welcoming environment for the players. I learned alot about the mental and physical demands of soccer through his guidance."
